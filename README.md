### Project Description

I'm Making basic Employee and Inventory ERP REST Application for creating future test repo with Rest Assured and BDD approach

### To connect to the service:
1. Launch EmployeedemoApplication.class 
2. Connect to the http://localhost:8080/employee-demo/stockData

For now there is only stockData.

### ToDo:
1. Add more REST API calls,
2. Create DB for basic CRUD Operation
3. Create models for each table
4. Create separate repo for tests with rest assured, and BDD approach
