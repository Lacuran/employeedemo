I'm Making basic Employee ERP REST Application to create future test repo with Rest Assured

To connect to the service:
1. Launch EmployeedemoApplication.class 
2. Connect to the http://localhost:8080/employee-demo/stockData

For now there is only stockData.

ToDo:
1. Add more REST API calls,
2. Create DB for basic CRUD Operation
3. Create separate repo for tests with rest assured, and BDD approach
